How to automatically render the .py and .html files every time you save a check point : http://svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/ (just check "Addendum" at the end of the article).
The .py file shows clearly what has been changed in the code between two commits, whereas the html files shows the output of the modifications (graphics, pictures...)

So, in each folder, you should find among other things : the iPython notebook (.ipynb), the python script (.py) which is basically the notebook but in a raw text format, and a final report which is made of an .html file and possibly pictures.
