# Obtain all the data for the Bachelor students, starting from 2007. Keep only the students for which you have an entry for both Bachelor semestre 1 and Bachelor semestre 6. Compute how many months it took each student to go from the first to the sixth semester. Partition the data between male and female students, and compute the average -- is the difference in average statistically significant?
